# Glean Tennessee

This project was created during Nashville's Civic Day of Hacking to allow farmers and other food providers to notify the [Society of St. Andrew](endhunger.org) of food donations available for harvest and pick up.

Currently, a Google version is in place until such time as this app is launched. This utilized a Google Form to collect donor information, then sends an email to the Society of St. Andrew.
